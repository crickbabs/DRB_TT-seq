# DRB_TT-seq

Scripts for the analysis of TT-seq and DRB/TT-seq data.

This is a companion repository to the publication below.  

It describes a pipeline for calling RNA Pol II transcription wave peak positions and elongation rates from DRB/TT-seq time-series data using R.  Instructions are given for calculating wave peaks at both the single-gene and meta-gene level.
